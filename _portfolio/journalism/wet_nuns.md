Following one of the hottest weekends we’ve seen in a while, the air turned cool and cloudy as a steady stream of people filtered in, ready to witness local two-piece Wet Nuns raise hell on a Sunday afternoon.

We walked into a wall of sound. ‘All the Young Girls’ was in full swing, with rapid percussion and a blistering guitar drenched in feedback. Dark and sweaty, the show was a stone’s throw from the Mississippi. Recent release ‘Broken Teeth’ was executed with precision, as were older tracks like ‘Heavens Below’.

Wet Nuns have been busy touring this year, and this was reflected in their tight performance and confident stage presence. In between songs about death there was plenty of crowd interaction, topped off with a brief guest appearance from Dead Sons’ drummer Bernie. Wet Nuns self-titled debut LP is set for release in October.
