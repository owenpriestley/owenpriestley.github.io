It’s minus fifteen here, but our neighbour Ralph tells us that the mysterious ‘windchill factor’ brought temperatures to minus twenty eight last night. We  happened to be walking home at around about that time (in a foolish attempt to save $2.70 worth of streetcar fare) and fortunate enough to experience these temperatures, existing in a state I can only describe as hysterical. We still managed to stop off and make essential purchases, however, such as a family-size bag of _Lays Ketchup Chips_ and a box of twenty _Rob Roasts_.

We made it home, rigid and trembling, and I reached for the only food on the shelf; a box of the long-life meat product: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Rod_(meat_snack)" target="_blank">Hot Rods</a> (ingredients: Chicken, Pork, Despair). I instantly regretted this, but will no doubt fall victim to Schneider’s charms again in the future.

Despite the sub-zero temperatures, this city is great. The people seem to live up to their ridiculously positive outlook and have welcomed us with open arms; despite our neighbours having to shovel eight inches of snow from the sidewalk daily, whilst I wave from the window, sitting and eating cereal in my unemployed pants.

Last night we visited The Roya; a 1930’s cinema with it’s original decor and one screen that plays three films a day. We caught the midnight showing of <a href="http://www.ourrobocopremake.com/" target="_blank">Our Robocop Remak</a>. The tickets were a bargain - five dollars each - but those five dollars are then returned to you in the form of food vouchers. Popcorn and a coffee will cost you five dollars, meaning either a free film or free food.

<h2 class="img">The only popcorn flavour available here is ‘melted butter’.</h2>

The movie itself was more bizarre than the pricing - fifty amateur filmmakers each remade a scene from the film, leading to a montage of incredibly obscure, funny and disturbing footage, but certainly worth a watch.
As if the levy at the cinema wasn’t alarming enough, just two blocks down there’s a fish restaurant, amiably christened The Happy Hooke, where one can procure <a href="http://www.thegridto.com/blog-posts/deals-on-meals-two-dollar-fish-and-chips-at-the-happy-hooker/" target="_blank">a portion of fish and chips</a> substantial enough to strip Cap’n Birdseye of his rank for a measly two dollars (that’s approximately £1.65).

Probably my new favourite place (until I conquer the axe throwing league described later in this posts) is Kensington Market; a dense, snow-covered bazaar that exports some of the finest vintage junk I have ever come across. We are in the land of the plaid shirt; there is a Levi-toting woodsman on every corner, cowboy boots on every dance floor, and the spoils are passed down to naive travellers such as ourselves; overwhelmed by the mounds of hand-me-down clobber.

Speaking of frozen goods, the weather forecast sits stubbornly south of zero degrees for the next couple of weeks, however there are rumours that on Thursday we’ll have a day with highs of one degree (huzzah!)

The only concrete thing on the itinerary at the minute is to visit <a href="http://www.blogto.com/fitness/backyard-axe-throwing-league-batl-grounds-toronto" target="_blank">BATL Grounds</a> (that stands for backyard axe throwing league, if you didn’t guess.) A relatively new development at the harbourfront, where you can drink beers and throw axes at wooden targets: yep, that’s right, job-hunting is on hold for a day or two.
