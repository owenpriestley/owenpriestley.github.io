# Owen Priestley

You're looking at my portfolio! I'm a technical writer for the software industry. You'll find samples of my work and my contact details on the full site [here](http://owenpriestley.github.io).

The site is built with Jekyll, hosted on GitHub pages, and uses a modified version of the Minimal Mistakes theme.
